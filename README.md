# Project Description

The Fake News Detection System is a machine learning–based application developed to classify news articles as real or fake using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project integrates SQL for structured data storage and management alongside machine learning for prediction.

News articles and their labels are stored in a relational database, enabling efficient data retrieval, filtering, and analysis using SQL queries. Text data is preprocessed using tokenization, stopword removal, and cleaning, followed by TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction. A supervised machine learning model is trained on the processed data and deployed using a Streamlit web interface for real-time prediction.

This project demonstrates end-to-end skills in data collection, SQL-based data handling, machine learning modeling, and application deployment.
